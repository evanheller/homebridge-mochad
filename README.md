# homebridge-mochad

This is a simple derivative of [homebridge-heyu](https://github.com/keithws/homebridge-heyu) 
that enables communication with X10 devices via [mochad](https://github.com/bjonica/mochad), 
a TCP gateway daemon for the X10 CM15A and CM19a RF controllers. It requires a running mochad daemon.
